Projects I've worked on including in:
  Delphi
  Python
  Java

I could not find the final version of my mini game, only GameTest.

I included a simple reaction time game I made in high school.

The python script for plex is used to run remote commands on a laptop

my school projects won't be able to run without the lisencing software for
the specific ide I coded them in, but you will be able to look at the code
in any text editor

CountPrimes is just a simple java programme I made while learning

while I cannot share my university projects due to the policies of my
university, I can show you them during an interview
