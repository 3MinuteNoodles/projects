Newton's laws of motion are three basic laws of classical mechanics that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws can be paraphrased as follows:

1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force.
2. When a body is acted upon by a force, the time rate of change of its momentum equals the force.
3. If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.
