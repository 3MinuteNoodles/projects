• A compound sentence contains two main
clauses joined by a comma and a
coordinating conjunction or a semi-colon.
• Compound sentences connect two simple
sentences, but they often do not show a
clear relationship between the two parts. 

• A complex sentence contains a main
clause and one or more dependent
clauses.
• If the dependent clause comes before the
independent clause, add a comma after
the dependent clause. If the main clause
comes first, no comma is needed between
the two.
• Complex sentences can show a more
specific relationship between the parts of
the sentence than a compound sentence.
