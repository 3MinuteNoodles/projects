Define: "An Electric Field"
A region in space in which an electric charge will experience a force
The sum of the electric charges in an area
The space where electons flow
rate of current
A point in space where charge moves

Define: "Electric Field Strength At a Point"
Rate of flow of charge at a point.
The potential difference to a reference point.
How strong a force is.
the force per positive unit charge at that point in the electric field.

State the law of conservation of charge.
For equal charges there is no force.
Charge cannot be created or destroyed but can only be tranferred from one object to another.
A positive charge cannot become negative.
Charge stays charge.
All of the above.

Define: "Electromagnetic induction"
All of the below
Induced charge stays constant.
Charge gets created in a conductor by a changing magnetic field.
A changing current induces a magnetic field.
The phenomenon where an Emf and therefore a current is induced in a conductor by a changing magnetic field.

State newton's 3rd law of motion.
Objects keep their momentum.
objects fall at the same rate in a vacuum.
Inertia is the conservation of momentum.
When body A exerts a force on body B, body B exerts a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction
Objects go brrr
